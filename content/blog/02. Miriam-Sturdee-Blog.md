redifining the view of research can lead to new insights.
its ok to challenge the status quo




#### Brief Summary of the Talk 
This talk was presented by *Miriam Sturdee* and focused on her sketches. The speaker started by discussing her change in careers along the years and then went onto discuss her papers that she worked on thoughout the years.

#### 1) What was the most surprising or thought-provoking idea from the talk?
Redifining the 'view' of research can change the insights of everyone. dont try and conform to everyone else in the industry, that is my 'biggest' takeaway that i got from her presentation. I assumed that alot of the industry would have a very conformist mindset but Miriams talk has showed me another side of this as she has pushed boundaries. 

#### 2) What questions or curiosities did this lecture spark for you? If you asked the speaker a question, what was their response?
She said alot of HCI projects arent finished alot of the time OR run out of funding. Truly good ideas people will jump at but at the starting life of these ideas people will think of them as being 'a waste' or cant justify the idea of keeping work on a project without enough funding. she spoke about her idea of her folding phone and it becoming a real thing at samsung after it got enough prototype variations and funding.


#### 3) What made you optimisitc about the future from this talk?
have fun, she challeneged the status queue and had a career while enjoying her work. This definetly made me alot more optimistic for my future in computing as i had a mindset of work being boring and it being not productive.

#### 4) What key ideas did the speaker highlight and why are they significant with respect to trends in computing?

#### 5) What ethical challenges might arise from the ideas covered in this talk, and how might they impact technology use?
Write your response here.
*an ethical challenge could be that higher ups could refuse this open mindededness and could shut this down*, IF this is the case this could limit technoligical creativity and could create a cookie cutter mentality within the industry. 


#### 6) Did you agree or disagree with the ideas the speaker covered? Why? Why not?
At first i did not agree when she displayed, "life is not fun" but as she explained why this is not the case i started to agree with her mindset on the industry.

#### 7) What role do you think the technology or concepts from this talk could play in influencing society in future?
In my honest opinion, no. I think her ideas are very interesting and can be broadly applied to the point where it can influence society, but Miriams sketching career and HCI career and her concepts wont play a part in influencing society.

#### 8) What connections can you make between this lecture and others in the series? (Ignore for the first talk).
